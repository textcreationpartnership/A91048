            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F his Majeſty had not given up all the faculties of his ſoul to an earneſt endeavour of a Peace, and reconciliation with his People, or if he would ſuffer himſelf by any Provecation to be drawn to a ſharpneſs of Language at a time, when there ſeems ſomewhat like an Overture of Accommedation, hee could not but reſent the heavy charges upon him in the Preamble of theſe Propoſitions, and would not ſuffer himſelf to be reproached with protecting of Delinquents by force from Juſtice, (his Majeſties deſire having always bin, that all men ſhould be Tryed by the knowne Law, and having been refuſed it) with raiſing an Army againſt his Parliament, and to be told that Armes have been taken up againſt him for defence of Religion, Laws, Liberties, Priviledges of Parliament, and for the ſitting of the Parliament in ſafety, with many other particulars in that Preamble, ſo often and ſo fully anſwered by his Majeſty, without remembring the World of the time, and circumſtances of raiſing thoſe Arms againſt him: when his Majſety was ſo far from being in a condition to invade other mens Rights, that he was not able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and defend his owne from violence; And without telling his good Subjects that their Religion (the true Proteſtant Religion, in which his Majeſty was born, hath faithfully lived, and to which he will die a willing Sacriſice) thier Laws, Liverties, Priviledges, and ſafety of Parliament were
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:111010:5"/>ſo amply ſetled, and eſtavliſhed; or offered to be ſo by his Majeſty before any Army was raiſed againſt him, and long before any raiſed by him for his defence, that if nothing had been deſired, but that Peace and Protection which his Subjects, and their Anceſtors had in the beſt times enjoyed under his Majeſty or his Royall Predeceſſors; this miſunderſtanding and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between his Majeſty and his people, and this generall miſery, and deſtraction upon the face of the whole Kingdome, had not beene now the diſcourſe of Chriſtendome: But his Majeſty will forbeare any Expreſſions of Bitterneſſe, or of a ſence of his own ſufferings, that if it be poſſible the memory thereof may be loſt to the World. And therefore though many of the Propoſitions, preſented to his Majeſty by both Houſes, appeare to him very derogatory from, and deſtructive to his juſt power and Prerogative, and no way beneficiall to his Subjects, few of them being already due to them by the Laws, eſtabliſhed, (And how unparliamentary it is by Arms to requite new Laws, all the World may judge) yet (becauſe theſe may be waved, or mollified, and many things that are now darke, or doubtfull in them, cleered and explained upon debate) his Majeſty is pleaſed (ſuch is his ſence of the miſeries, this Kingdome ſuffers by this unnaturall war, and his earneſt deſire to remove them by a happy peace) that a ſpeedy time and place may be agreed upon for the meeting of ſuch perſons as his Majeſty and both Houſes ſhall appoint to diſcuſſe theſe Propoſitions, and ſuch others here following, as His Majeſty doth propoſe to them.</p>
               <p n="1">1 THat his Majeſties own Revenue, Magazins. Townes, Forts, and Ships which have been taken, or kept from his by force, be forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with reſtored unto him.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That whatſoever hath been done or publiſhed, contrary to the known Laws of the Land, or derogatory to his Majeſties Legall, and known pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and rights, he renounced and recalled, that no ſeed may remaine for the like to ſpring out of for the future.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That whatſoever illegall power hath bin claimed and exerciſed by, or over his Subjects, as impriſoning their perſons without Law, ſtopping thier <hi>Habeas Corpuſſes.</hi> and impoſing upon thier Eſtates without Act of Parliament, &amp;c. either by both, or either Houſe, or any Committee of both, or either by any perſons appointed by any of them, be diſclaimed, and all ſuch perſons ſo committed, forthwith diſcharged.</p>
               <p n="4">4 That as His Majeſty will readily conſent (having done ſo heretofore) to the execution of all Laws already made, and to any good Acts to be made for the ſuppreſſing of Popery, and for the firme ſetling of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:111010:6"/>Religion now eſtabliſhed by Law: so hee deſires that a good Bill may be framed for the better preſerving of the Book of Common Prayer, from the ſcorn and violence of Browniſts, Anabaptiſts and other Sectaries with ſuch clauſes, for the eaſe of tender conſciences, as his Majeſty hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly offered.</p>
               <p n="5">5 That all ſuch perſons as upon the Treaty ſhall be excepted out of the Generall Pardon, ſhall be tryed <hi>per Pares,</hi> according to the uſuall courſe, and known Law of the Land, and that it be left to that, either to acquit, or condemne them.</p>
               <p n="6">6 And to the intent this Treaty may not ſuffer interruption by any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervening Accidents, that a Ceſſation of Armes, and free Trade, for all his Majeſties Subjects, may be firſt agreed upon.</p>
               <p>This offer and deſire of His Majeſtie he hopes will be ſo cheerfully enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that a ſpeedy and bleſſed Peace may be accompliſhed. If it ſhall be rejected, or by inſiſting upon unreaſonable Circumſtances, be made impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible (which he hopes God in his mercy to this Nation will not ſuffer) the guilt of the Bloud which will be ſhed, and the deſolation which muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, will lie upon the head, of the Refuſers. However his Majeſty is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, through what accidents ſoever he ſhall be compelled to recover his Rights, and with what proſperous ſucceſses ſoever, it ſhall pleaſe God, to bleſs him, that by his earneſs, conſtant endeavours to propagate and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the true Proteſtant Religion, and by his Governing according to the known Laws of the Land, and upholding the juſt priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to his frequent Proteſtations made before Almighty God, which he will always in violably obſerve. The world ſhall ſee that he hath undergone all theſe difficulties, and hazards for the defence and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of thoſe, the zealous Preſervation of which his Majeſty well knows, is the onely foundation, and means for the true happineſs of him, and his People.</p>

               <p>HIs Majeſty hath immediately upon their arrivall admitted the Committee ſent to Him from both Houſes of Parliament (as the Meſſengers of Peace) to his Royall Preſence, and received the Articles of Ceſſation brought by them, which are in effect the ſame his Majeſty formerly excepted to, though their expreſſion in the Preface to theſe Articles of their readineſſe to agree to thoſe Alterations, and Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions offered by his Majeſty in ſuch manner as is expreſſed, made Him expect to have found at leaſt ſome of the reall Alterations, and Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made by him admitted, which He doth not diſcover.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His Majeſty deſired the Proviſion might be made, and Licence given to his good Subjects, for their freedome of Trade, Traffique and Commerce, (though in matters which concerned Himſelfe more immediately, as in Armes, Ammunition, Money, Bullion, and Victuall, for the uſe of his Army, and the Paſſage of all Officers and Souldiers of his army, Hee was contented the reſtraint ſhould be in ſuch manner as was propoſed) of which his Majeſtie is ſo tender, that as he hath provided for the ſame by His gracious Proclamations, ſo He doth daily releaſe and diſcharge ſuch Merchandize and Commodities, as are contrary to thoſe Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſtayed by any of his Majeſties Forces.</p>
               <p>To this freedome and liberty of his good ſubjects, there is not the leaſt admiſſion given by theſe Articles, ſo that they have not any Eaſe or bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by this Ceſſation, which his Majeſtie deſires both Houſes to conſider of, and whether, if his Majeſtie ſhould take the ſame courſe to ſtop and interrupt the Trade of the Kingdome, as the other Army doth, a generall loſſe and Calamity would not ſeize upon his good Subjects.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His Majeſty to the end that a full Ceſſation might be as well at Sea as at Land, and He might be ſecured, that the Ships propoſed to be ſet forth for the Defence of his Majeſties Dominions, ſhould be employed onely to that end and purpoſe, deſired, that they might be put under the Command of Perſons to be approved of by his Majeſty, which is not conſented to by theſe Articles, but their former, to which his Majeſty excepted, ſtrictly and entirely inſiſted on, by which (beſides that part of Hoſtilitie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines)
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:111010:12"/>the conveying of any number of Forces from any part to any other, by that meanes, remaine free to them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the Prevention of any Inconveniences which might ariſe upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Differences, or Miſtakes upon the Latitude of expreſſions (as if his Majeſty ſhould now conſent to theſe Articles propoſed, in the Termes propoſed, He muſt confeſſe the Army, of which he complaines, to bee ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Parliament, and either himſelfe to be no part of the Parliament, or Himſelfe to have raiſed that Army) and for prevention of that delay which He foreſaw could not otherwiſe be avoyded, if upon every Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the Queſtions muſt be remitted to <hi>London,</hi> His Majeſty deſired that the Committee (for whom He then ſent a ſafe Conduct) might have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to debate any ſuch Differences and Expreſſions, and reconcile the ſame, that all poſſible Expedition might be uſed to the mayne Treaty.</p>
               <p>In this point of ſo high Concernment, no power is given in theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and the Committee confeſſed to his Majeſty they have no power given, but are ſtrictly and preciſely bound to the very words of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles now ſent, and that before theſe are conſented to by us, they cannot enter into any Treaty concerning the other Propoſitions.</p>
               <p n="4">4. His Majeſty deſired, that during the Ceſſation none of his good ſubjects might be impriſoned, otherwiſe then according to the knowne Lawes of the Land.</p>
               <p>This is in no degree conſented to, but the priviledge and liberty, (to which they were borne) reſerved from them till the disbanding of both armies (though they are no part of either Army) and ſo have no benefit by this Ceſſation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. His Majeſty deſired, that during this Ceſſation there ſhould be no Plundering or violence offered to any of his Subjects.</p>
               <p>In the Anſwer to which, His deſire againſt violence, is not at all taken notice of, nor is his deſire againſt Plundering any wayes ſatisfied; his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, not only intending by it the robbing of the Subject by the unruli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the uncommanded Souldier (which their clauſe of requiring the Generalls and officers to keep them from it ſeemes to imply; And the aſſertion, that the two Houſes of Parliament had ever diſliked, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden it, declares plainly, to be their only meaning) but particularly the violence and Plundring us'd to his Subjects by forcibly taking away their goods for not ſubmitting to Impoſitions and Taxes required from them by Orders or Ordinances of one or both houſes of Parliament, which are contrary to the knowne Lawes of the Land.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:111010:13"/> Beſides that there is no conſent given to thoſe alterations and additions offered by his Majeſty, (whatſoever is pretended) ſo where an abſolute conſent may be ſuppoſed, becauſe the very words of his Majeſties Article are wholly preſerved, yet by Reaſon of the Relation to ſomewhat going before, that is varyed by them, the ſence of thoſe words is wholly varyed too, as in the fourth Article, that part of the Third article to which that did referre, being wholly left out. So that upon the matter all the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions made by his Majeſty (which did not in Tearmes agree with thoſe preſented to him) are utterly rejected.</p>
               <p>For theſe Reaſons, and that this Entrance towards a bleſſed Peace and Accommodation (which hath already filled the hearts of the Kingdome with Joye and Hop:) may be improved to the wiſhed end, his Majeſty deſires, that the Committee now ſent, may ſpeedily have liberty to treate, debate, and agree upon the Articles of Ceſſation, in which they and all the world ſhall find, that his Majeſtie is leſſe ſollicitous for his owne Dignity and Greatneſſ, then for his ſubjects Eaſe and Liberty. And Hee doubts not upon ſuch a Debate all differences concerning the Ceſſation will be eaſily and ſpeedily agreed upon, and the benefit of a Ceſſation bee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued and confirmed to his People by a ſpeedy disbanding of both Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and a ſudden and firme Peace, which his Majeſty above all things deſires.</p>
               <p>If this ſo reaſonalbe, equall, and juſt Deſire of his Majeſty ſhall not be yeelded unto, but the ſame Articles ſtill inſiſted upon, though his Majeſty next to Peace deſires a Ceſſation, Yet that the not agreeing upon the one, may not deſtroy the hopes of, nor ſo much as delay the other; He is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling however to Treate (even without a Ceſſation, if that bee not gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) upon the Propoſitions themſelves, in that order as is agreed upon (and deſires the Committee here may be enabled to that effect) In which Treaty Hee ſhall give all his Subjects that ſatisfaction, That if any Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to enjoy all the Rights, Priviledges and Liberties due to them by the Law, or that happineſſe in Church and State, which the beſt times have ſeene, with ſuch farther acts of Grace as may agree with his Honour, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Duty to his Crowne, and as may not render Him leſſe able to protect His Subjects according to his Oath, will ſatisfie them; Hee is confident in the mercy of God, that no more pretious blood of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will be thus miſerably ſpent.</p>

               <head type="sub">To the KINGS moſt Excellent MAJESTY.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lords and Commons in Parliament Aſſembled, Do with all hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thankefulneſſe acknowledge Your Majeſties favour in the ſpeedy admiſſion of their Committee to Your Royall Preſence, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition of Your Exceptions to their Articles, that ſo they might more ſpeedily endeavour to give Your Majeſtie ſatisfaction; And although they were ready to agree to the Articles of Ceſſation, in ſuch manner as they expreſt in their Preface, they cannot agree to the alteration and addition offered by Your Maieſty, without great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the Cauſe, and danger to the Kingdom; whoſe cauſe it is: The reaſons whereof, will cleerly appear in the anſwer to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars preſt by Your Majeſtie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. THey do deny that they have reſtrained any Trade, but to ſome few of thoſe places where Your Majeſties forces are enquartered, and even now in the heat of War do permit the Carriers to go into all the parts of the Kingdom, with all ſorts of commodities for the uſe of the Subjects; except Arms, Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, money, and Bullion: But if they ſhould grant ſuch a free Trade as Your Majeſty deſireth to <hi>Oxford</hi> and other places, where Your forces remain, It would be very difficult, if not impoſſible to keepe Arms, Ammunition, money, and Bullion from paſſing into Your Majeſties Army, without very ſtrict and frequent ſearches, which would make it ſo troubleſome, chargeable, and dangerous to the Subjects, That the queſtion being but for twenty dayes for ſo few places, the miſchiefs and inconveniences to the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome would be far greater, than any advantage which that ſmall number of Your Subjects (whom it concerns) can have by it.</p>
               <p>The caſe then is much otherwiſe than is expreſt by Your Majeſties Anſwer; for whereas they are charged not to give the leaſt admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this liberty and freedom of Trade during the ceſſation, The truth is, that they do grant it as fully to the benefit of the Subject, even in time of War; and that Your Majeſty in preſſing this for the peoples good, doth therein deſire that which will be very little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall to the Subjects, but exceeding advantagious to Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, in ſupplying Your Army with many neceſſaries, and making Your quarters a ſtaple for ſuch commodities, as may be vented in the adjacent Counties, and ſo draw money thither, whereby the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:111010:15"/>Inhabitants will be better enabled by Loans and contributions to ſupport Your Majeſties Army; And as Your Majeſties Army may receive much advantage, and the other Army much danger, if ſuch freedom ſhould be granted to thoſe places; ſo there is no probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that the Army raiſed by the Lords and Commons ſhall have any return of commodities and other ſupplies from thence, which may be uſefull for them: And they conceive that in a Treaty for a Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, thoſe demands cannot be thought reaſonable which are not indifferent, that is equally advantagious to both parties.</p>
               <p>As they have given no interruption to the Trade of the Kingdom, but in relation to the ſupply of the contrary Army, which the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of War requires; So they beſeech Your Majeſty to conſider, whether Your ſouldiers have not robbed the Carriers in ſeverall parts where there hath been no ſuch reaſon, And Your ſhips taken many ſhips, to the great dammage not only of particular Merchants, but of the whole Kingdom. And whether Your Majeſty have not declared Your own purpoſe, and endeavoured by Your miniſters of State, to embarque the merchants goods in forreign parts, which hath been in ſome meaſure executed upon the Eaſt-land merchants in <hi>Denmarke,</hi> and is a courſe which will much diminiſh the wealth of the Kingdom, violate the law of Nations, make other Princes Arbiters of the differences betwixt Your Majeſty and Your people, break off the intercourſe between this and other States, and like to bring us into quarrells and diſſentions with all the neighbour Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To demand the approving of the Commanders of the Ships, is to deſire the ſtrength of one party to the other, before the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be ended, and againſt all Rules of Treaty; To make a ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at Sea, would leave the Kingdom naked to thoſe forreign for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which they have great cauſe to believe have been ſollicited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and the Ports open for ſuch ſupplies of Arms and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition as ſhall be brought from beyond the ſeas: But for convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any number of forces by thoſe means from one part to another, they ſhall obſerve the Articles of the Ceſſation by which that is Reſtrained.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As for the expreſſion of the Army raiſed by the Parliament, They are contented it ſhould be altered thus (raiſed by both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Parliament) as not deſiring to differ upon words, but to give any conluſive power in this caſe to the Committee, upon ſuch diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences as may ariſe, wherein the Houſes have given no expreſſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:111010:16"/>is neither ſafe for the Committee to undertake, nor fit for the two Houſes to grant; yet to debate and to preſſe the reaſon of their deſires, whereby an agreement from Your Majeſty may bee procured, is granted to them; and although the two Houſes did think it <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> proper the Ceſſation ſhould be firſt agreed on, and that it was unfit to treat in bloud; yet to ſatisfie the world of their ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt longing after peace, they have given power to the Committees to enter into the treaty upon the two firſt Propoſitions, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Ceſſation be not yet aſſented to; And thoſe being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, they hope the foundation will be layd, not only of a ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but a totall aboliſhion of all hoſtility in the Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If the nature of War be duly conſidered, it muſt needs be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, That it is incompetible with the ordinary rules of a peaceable government; Your Majeſty would have them commit none but according to the known Laws of the Land, whereby they conceive Your Majeſty underſtands, that it muſt be by the ordinary Proceſſe of Law, which being granted, it will follow, That no man <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> be committed by them for ſupplying Your Majeſty with Arms, Powder and Ammunition; for by the Law of the Land, the Subject may <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſuch goods from <hi>London</hi> or any other place to <hi>Oxford;</hi> the Souldiers moſt not be committed if they run from their Colours, and refuſe any duty in the Army, No man ſhall be committed for not ſubmitting to neceſſary ſupplies of money; ſo that if this bee yeelded in Your Majeſties ſenſe, they ſhall be diſabled to reſtrain ſupplies from <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> enemies, and to govern or maintain their owne Souldiers; it cannot be thought reaſonable, that under the diſguiſe of a Ceſſation, they ſhould admit that which will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily produce the diſſolving of the Army, and deſtruction of the Cauſe.</p>
               <p>It ſeems not probable. That Your Majeſty doth intend that if any be taken with ſupplies for this Army, or <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>tining in Your own, that ſuch perſons ſhall not be committed, but according to the knowne Laws of the Land, that is, by Proceſſe of Law; Put rather that your Majeſty will ſo interpret this limitation of knowne Lawes, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it layes ſtraight <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> upon the two Houſes, yet it leaves Your Generalls as much liberty as before; for it hath been denied by your Majeſty, that theſe knowne Lawes give any power to the two Houſes of Parliament to raiſe Arms, and ſo conſequently their Generall cannot exerciſe any marſhall law in thoſe caſes, and it is not unlike but that it will be a<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ed. That the Generalls conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:111010:16"/>by your Majeſties Commiſſion, have that power by the ſame known Laws; So that this Article under the ſpecious ſhew of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Law, would altogether diſable them to defend their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and Lawes, and would produce to your Majeſty an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute victory, and ſubmiſſion under pretence of a Ceſſation and treaty.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Being by neceſſity inevitable on their part enforced to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive Warre in this unhappy breach betweene your Majeſty and them, and that they are therein warranted both by the Lawes of God, and man, it muſt needs follow, that by the ſame Law they are enabled to raiſe means to ſupport that Warre; And therefore till it ſhall pleaſe God to encline your Majeſty to afford them ſuch a peace as may ſecure them, they cannot relinquiſh the power of laying taxes upon thoſe who ought to joyn with them in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and the neceſſary wayes of leavying thoſe taxes upon them, in caſe of refuſall, for otherwiſe their Army muſt needs be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. But if your Majeſty ſhall conſent to disband the Armies, the cauſe of the Warre being taken away, the conſequences will likewiſe be removed, and the Subject reſtored to the benefit of thoſe Lawes which the neceſſity of Arms hath in ſuch caſes ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They deny any pretence of conſenting to thoſe alterations and additions offered by your Majeſty, only in the Preamble they ſay they have conſidered of thoſe Articles, with ſuch alterations and additions, unto which Articles they profeſt they were ready to agree, not as they were accompanied with thoſe alterations and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, but in ſuch manner as they expreſſed; As for the clauſe left out in the third Article, it implied a freedome of paſſage and communication of quarters, which is contrary to the nature of a Ceſſations whereby matters ſhould bee preſerved in the ſtate they are, and neither party have liberty ſo much to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage himſelfe, as it is evident your Majeſty might doe, if Your Forces in the North and Weſt might joyne with thoſe at OXFORD, and bring thoſe ſupplies of treaſure or Armes thither which were brought out of HOLLAND, or at leaſt it ſhould be ſo indifferent as to give a proportionable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the other ſide, which this doth not; for the Forces under the power of both Houſes are ſo diſpoſed, that they have an eaſie paſſage from one to the other; but your Majeſties Forces are ſevered the one from the other by many large Counties,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:111010:17"/>ſtrong paſſes, and competent Armies, and if they had admitted this clauſe, they had bereaved themſelves of one of the greateſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, and freed Your Majeſties party of one of the greateſt inconveniencies, which your Majeſty, or they have in this War.</p>
               <p>For the Reaſons already alleadged, They cannot agree to the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations and enlargements of the Ceſſation propounded, or to transferre any ſuch power to the Committee of Treating, debating and agreeing upon thoſe Articles in any other manner than the Houſes have directed, but that a fair and ſpeedy paſſage may bee opened to a ſecure and a happy Peace; They have enabled their Committees to treat and debate upon the two Propoſitions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning His Majeſties own Revenue, the delivery of His Townes, Caſtles, Magazines, and Ships, and the disbanding of the Armies, which being agreed upon, a preſent peace and ſecurity will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and the Treaty upon the other Propoſitions bee facilitated without feare of interruption, by the confuſion of Warre, or exaſperation of either party, by the bloody effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>In which Treaty, the two Houſes will deſire and expect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what doth ſtand with. Your Majeſties Honour, and the truſt repoſed in You, and is neceſſary for Your Majeſties good Subjects, that they may enjoy the true Religion, and their Liberties, and Priviledges, and that they may freely and in a Parliamentary way concurre with Your Majeſty in thoſe things which may conduce to the glory of God, the ſafety and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe of Your Majeſty, and Your Poſterity and people, and preventing the like miſerable effuſion of Engliſh bloud for the time to come; for the effecting whereof, Their moſt earneſt Prayers, and uttermoſt endeavours ſhall ever be faithfullly and conſtantly employed, in hope that God will give a bleſſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>

               <p>HOw His Majeſty hath ſpent His time ſince the Committee from His two Houſes of Parliament came hither, how willing <hi>Hee</hi> hath been (during the four dayes allowed to them) to expedite the Treaty it ſelfe, by the free and diligent diſquiſition of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars comprized in thoſe two firſt Articles, and how intent He hath been upon the Ceſſation (which He thinks ſo neceſſary, and ſo much deſires) ſince the laſt Meſſage concerning the ſame came to Him, the Committee themſelves cannot but obſerve: And though no concluſion could be made within the two dayes (a time limited with much ſtrictneſſe in a buſineſſe of ſo great moment, where all words and expreſſions muſt be carefully and exactly weighed) His Majeſty cannot doubt but both Houſes will be willing to give and receive ſatisfaction in any particulars which are neceſſarily to bee conſidered in concluding the ſame, though the two dayes are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired. And if His Majeſty enlarges Himſelfe in His Replies more than may ſeem neceſſary to the Propoſitions and differences in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, It muſt be remembred by what unneceſſary and unwarrantable Expreſſions in this laſt Meſſage from His two Houſes; He is not only invited, but compelled thereunto, which He could heartily have wiſhed might upon this occaſion have been forborne.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the freedom of trade, His Majeſty hath great reaſon to require, and the two Houſes to admit that freedom to His good Subjects He deſired; For what concerns the ſupply of the Army with Arms, Ammunition, money, Bullion, and Victuals, He conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the very tearms propoſed by the two Houſes; and that they may be obſerved, is contented that ſearches may be made, which being but the trouble of particular perſons, is not conſiderable, in reſpect of the publique benefit and advantage. But why all other liberty of traffique and Commerce ſhould not be granted to His good Subjects, He cannot underſtand; for that His Majeſties ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie ſhould receive much advantage thereby, and the contrary army none, is in no degree confeſſed: For (beſides, the reſtraint is to places where no part of His Majeſties army is, and indeed the whole trade of the Kingdom interrupted) tis as great a ſupport (if not a greater) to the contrary army, to maintain and keepe up the trade of <hi>London,</hi> from whence that receives its ſupply and reliefe, as to his Majeſties army to continue the trade of <hi>Oxford,</hi> or any other
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:111010:19"/>place where Forces recide, and to ſtop and ſeize the cloth, Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ies, and other Weſtern commodities (which his Majeſty can daily do from <hi>Reading</hi>) would be as great diſturbance to the Trade of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> as the ſeizing of any commodities (which may be done by the E. of Eſſex from <hi>Windſor</hi> or <hi>Wickham</hi>) can be to the Trade of <hi>Oxford;</hi> And therefore his Majeſty hath great reaſon to preſſe, that mutuall and univerſall Freedom to all his good ſubjects may be granted; Otherwiſe, he muſt either permit that Licence to his army, to ſeize the goods of his people in their paſſage to <hi>London,</hi> and to interrupt and break the Trade and correſpendence of the Kingdom (which bott our of publique conſideration, and private compaſſion, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty is moſt averſe from) or elſe muſt grant that evident benefit and advantage to thoſe who deny the ſame to him, and to his people for his ſake. And it cannot be denyed, but this Freedom is ſo very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall to his ſubject, and ſo wholly conſiderable to his Majeſtie under that Notion, that their very ſubſiſtance depends upon it, and by this means Trade may be continued, which, if a little more ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by theſe diſtractions, will not be eaſily recovered, even by a ſetled Peace. His Majeſty believes that ſome Carriers have bin rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by his Majeſties ſouldiers, But tis as true that no complaint hath been made to him of that kind, which he hath not received to the relief and reparation of the Petitioners. And tis therefore his deſire that both Houſes would joyn with him (at leaſt during the Ceſſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) that there might be no more ſuch violences and interruptions offered to his good Subjects by either ſide.</p>
               <p>For the imbarquing the Merchants Goods in forreign parts, his Majeſty denies that any endeavour hath yet been made by his Miniſters of State to that purpoſe. But 'tis true, his Majeſty hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Reſolution, which he ſhall purſue, that ſuch perſons who abſolve themſelves from their obedience to him, and aſſiſt or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to Actions of diſloyalty to him here, ſhall be deprived of thoſe advantages, and muſt not expect that Protection from him abroad, which is due, and which he alwaies hath and will allow to his good ſubjects. And this is not to make other Princes Arbiters of the differences betwixt his Majeſty and his people, but to uſe the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall amity and correſpondence with other Princes, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and ſupport of that dignity for which it is made and entred into.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His Majeſty did not demand the approving of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of ſhips onely, with reference to his preſent Right, for then
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:111010:19"/>he would have demanded, not the approbation of the Commanders, but the ſhips themſelves. But this demand was and is a thing moſt necceſſary for his Majeſty, for the ſetting out the preſent Fleet, is pretended to be for the defence of his Majeſties Dominions, and which cannot conveniently ſuffer any alteration in Commanders, if the Ceſſation and Peace ſhould be fully &amp; ſpeedily agreed upon. And therefore tis moſt neceſſary for his Majeſty, to know both the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, and to approve of the Commanders, who will not be ſo fit to be altered, when once they are ſent out.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty cannot ſee how a Ceſſation at Sea between his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie and his Subjects, ſhould leave the Kingdom naked to forreign Forces (a continuance of War may well do it:) And his Majeſty is willing to concur in the reſiſtance of all ſuch, of what kinde ſoever, and expects that during the Ceſſation, the conveying of all Forces from one part to another by Sea, for the Aſſiſtance of the Earl of <hi>ESSEX</hi> be reſtrained, which both <hi>Houſes</hi> ſeem now to conſent to, which was not at all expreſſed in their former Articles.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His Majeſties opinion, how unfit it was to Treat in Bloud, ſufficiently appears, this debate concerning a Ceſſation ariſing firſt from his Majeſties motion (it being left out in the Anſwer to his Meſſage for a Treaty:) In order to which, he had and hath great reaſon to deſire, that the Committee may have liberty to debate and conclude any differences and Expreſſions in the Articles of the Ceſſation, that the ſame may be reconciled and removed, without remitting all Queſtions to <hi>London;</hi> For as thoſe now conſented to, might in much leſſe time have been agreed here, if there had been that liberty, ſo there can hardly be a right and cleer underſtanding of Intentions, without expounding of words, and knowing the meaning from each other; as in the conſent which his Majeſty now underſtands to be given by both Houſes, that no Forces ſhall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Ceſſation be ſent by Sea for the relief of any place now held by them, the expreſsion is not ſo cleer, but referreth to Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, in which if it was not compriſed before (as his Majeſty doth not conceive it was) no alteration is made, by what now ſeems to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to, and the liberty which to all underſtandings may ſeem to be given, by removing out of one quarter to another, within the Precincts propoſed, is not yet ſo demonſtrable; The Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee having no power to Anſwer what they underſtand in that point which is moſt neceſſary to be known, that the Peace be not broken, during that Ceſſation; And his Majeſty wonders that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:111010:20"/>it ſhould be thought unſafe or unfit to give ſuch a concluſive power of ſuch differences and doubts to the Committee here, when tis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly known, that the very Liberty and property of the Subject is committed not only to other Committees of the Houſes, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting to the Houſes, but to perſons who are imployed by them, unintereſſed in, and unacquainted with the directions of either, or both Houſes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It was no part of his Majeſties intention, that his Article a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Impriſonment of his ſubjects, otherwiſe then according to the known Laws of the land, ſhould extend to the deſtruction of the Military Diſcipline of either army; But this is a very ſufficient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the neceſſity of inabling ſome perſons to conclude upon theſe Articles, without which (through inanimadvertence or doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe in the expreſſions(they who are neereſt of a minde, will hardly ever come to conclude, if every Punctilio muſt be forced to be ſent forwards and backwards a hundred miles; And (if this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority had been given to the Committee here, as for ſuch cauſes was deſired) limitation of half a dozen words (which would have been as ſoon agreed to as propoſed) would have ſaved moſt of this fourth Reaſon. And he that deſires any thing neceſſary to the ſpeed of this Ceſſation, gives a good argument of deſiring the Ceſſation it ſelf, and whoever is averſe to the one, can hardly be thought inclinable to the other.</p>
               <p>But ſuch of his ſubjects as are not concern'd in the diſcipline of the army, are not concernd in this Objections; and his Majeſty hath reaſon to inſiſt that the ſame Liberty may be reſtored to them, in which they were born, and the care and defence of which is ſo much and ſo meerly pretended by thoſe who deny it to them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Though it grieves his Majeſty to the ſoul, to ſee the preſent miſerable condition of his ſubjects, groaning under ſo many viſible preſſures, becauſe of an inviſible neceſſity, and plundered and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned to maintain ſuch a defenſive War, as was begun to be raiſed againſt him before his Majeſty had granted one Commiſſion to raiſe a man; yet he cannot but be pleaſed with the ingenuity of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that the implicite Faith of his ſeduced ſubjects begins to weare out ſo faſt, that the authority of Declaring new, unknown Fundamentall Laws, doth not now ſo work with them, to believe that theſe Taxes are laid according to the Laws of God and man, nor the many pretences of imminent dangers, and inevitable ruine of their Religion, Laws and Liberties, ſo perſwade them to believe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:111010:20"/>this Cauſe, to be the Cauſe of the Kingdom; But that if their Cauſe, Authority and Eloquence were not aſſiſted by Force and Rapine, their army muſt needs be diſſolved for want of being thought fit, much leſſe neceſſary to be paid by thoſe who have equall right to judge of the neceſſity and danger, and for whoſe ſakes, intereſts and concernments onely it was pretended to be raiſed, and who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by it againſt their wills; Nor is it ſtrange that his Majeſty cannot receive theſe charges upon him, as a reaſon to make him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented and <hi>Acquieſce</hi> with theſe injuries to his ſubjects; Or that they who ſaw his Majeſties condition the laſt yeer (till continued violence againſt him, opened the eyes and hearts of his ſubjects to his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) ſhould not believe that the began that War, which they ſaw him ſo unlikely to reſiſt; Or that they, who could never finde, nor hear from them (who uſe not too modeſtly to conceal what is for their advantage) that from the beginning of the world to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Parliament, ever one man was raiſed before by Commiſſion from both Houſes, ſhould not believe the raiſing of that ther army to be ſo warranted as is pretended, and any more approve of their Law, then of their Neceſſity; Or that they who know that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty (in whom the power of making <hi>WAR</hi> and <hi>PEACE</hi> was never denied to be, till theſe new Doctrines, which make it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for Him to do any thing, and lawfull to do any thing againſt Him, were of late diſcovered) though He can legally raiſe an army, is not allowed to be legally able to raiſe Money to maintain it, will not allow of the argument, from the power of Raiſing, to the power of Taxing, and are as little ſatisfied with their Logick, as with their Law, and extremely troubled to pay an army they do not deſire, for a Neceſſity they cannot ſee, by a Law they never heard of; And that other men without their conſent muſt be jealous, fearfull, and quick-ſighted at their charges, and they have great reaſon to be apt to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that thoſe made moſt haſte to make a War, and have leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of making Peace, who in time of War pretend their legall power to be ſo vaſtly inlarged; His Majeſty therefore hath great reaſon to inſiſt, that no Violence or Plundering be offered to his ſubjects for not ſubmitting to the illegall Taxes of one or both Houſes, which in it ſelf is equall; His Majeſty being willing to be oblig'd from the like courſe, and relying wholly upon the known juſtice of his Cauſe, and the affection of his people, and in which (if the Kingdom be of their minde, and believe the cauſe of the contrary army to be really their own) the advantage will be wholly theirs, and this judgement will

               <p>His Majeſties reall deſire of disbanding the Armies, may fully appear by His often ſeeking, and earneſt endeavours to continue and conclude this treaty in order to that disbanding.</p>
               <p n="6">6. His Majeſty leaves their Preamble to all the world to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and to judge, whether any man by their ſaying they were ready to agree to his Majeſties Articles, in the manner as was expreſt, would not have expected to have found after that expreſſion, that they had agreed at leaſt to ſome one thing materiall in them, and had not only meant by agreeing as was expreſt, to expreſſe they would not agree at all.</p>
               <p>For the clauſe of Communication of quarters ſo quietly left out, His Majeſty looks upon it as of moſt infinite importance, the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, out of that, having diſ-compoſed the whole, many things ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the reſt been aſſented to, which were therfore only yeelded, becauſe the inconveniences growing by theſe clauſes, if they were alone, were ſalved by that addition; and ſome things in the other very dark and doubtfull, were by that interpreted and cleered. And his Majeſty is ſufficiently informed how highly it concerns him, that every thing be ſo cleer, that after no differences may ariſe upon any diſputable point, ſince they whoſe union, induſtry, ſubtilty and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice could perſwade any of his people, that in the buſines of <hi>Braince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> he had broken a Ceſſation before any was made or offered, would have a much eaſier work to lay the breach of a made ceſſation to his Majeſties charge, if the ground of that breach would beare the leaſt diſpute.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty doth agree, That to preſerve things in the the ſame ſtate on both ſides, with as little advantage or diſadvantage to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the matter will poſſibly bear, is truly the nature of a Ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and is willing this principle ſhould be made the rule, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intended any thing that ſhould contradict it; But cannot ſee the inequality in this which is pretended; For could Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> come by this means to the King, and not the Earl of <hi>Stamford,</hi> and Lord <hi>Fairſax</hi> to the Earl of <hi>Eſſex?</hi> Nor can his Majeſty finde any ſtrong paſſes or forces to hinder his armies from joyning with him, then hinders theirs from joyning with them. If the forces be unequall, theirs will hardly hinder the paſſage of his without a ceſſation; if they be equall, their coming in time of ceſſation, will be of equall uſe and advantage to their ſide, ſomewhat
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:111010:21"/>in point of ſupplies to come with them excepted; &amp; ſome advantage to one ſide will be, poize it how you will. But on the other ſide, it this clauſe be not in, how much greater is the diſadvantage the the other way by ſome clauſes? And how are his Forces (princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally the Earle of <hi>Newcaſtles</hi>) cooped up in old and eaten up quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of neceſſitated to retire to ſuch as are more barren and more eaten; so that if this were yeilded to, under the diſguiſe of a Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, He muſt admit that which will much endanger the diſſolving of the Army, and deſtruction of the Cauſe, which is ſuch a diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, as is againſt the nature of a Ceſſation formerly agreed and eſtated.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all this, His Majeſty to ſhew his extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and aboundant deſire of Peace, and to prevent the effuſion of bloud, is contented, if both Houſes ſhall refuſe to conſent to his Propoſitions, which are ſo much for the benefit and advancement of the publique trade, and advantage of his good Subjects, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a ceſſation upon the matter of their own Articles (excepting that liberty be given to the Committee to word it, according to the reall meaning and intention. And that the remove of quarters within their own bounds, which is intended, may be ſo expreſt and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that no miſtakes may ariſe,) So that his Majeſty may not bee underſtood to conſent to any impoſing upon, leavying, diſtraining, or impriſoning his good Subjects to force them to contribute, or aſſiſt againſt him (which he ſhall alwayes continue to inhibit, Requiring all men to reſiſt thoſe illegall Acts of injuſtice and violence, againſt which he doth abſolutely Proteſt;) And ſo that there may not be a liberty for any Rapine, Plundering, or ſeizing upon his Subjects, by any of the Souldiers of that Army, for not ſubmitting to ſuch illegall impoſitions as aforeſayd; For otherwiſe, they may during this Ceſſation (beſides what is already impoſ'd) impoſe new Taxes, not onely to the Nineteenth part, but if they pleaſe (for their pleaſure is all their bound) to the half of, or all their Eſtates upon his good Subjects in his City of <hi>London,</hi> and all Counties within their reach; and their army would then be at leiſure to be emploied as Collectors aſwell of the old impoſitions, (which in moſt places without their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my they cannot leavy) as of any ſuch new one, and vaſt ſums would and might by this means be raiſed to the deſtruction of his Subjects, extraordinary advantage to them, and great diſadvantage to his MAJESTIE; Who can neither obtaine His owne Conſent to take the like courſes, Nor in caſe Hee could, is Hee ſo
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:111010:22"/>quartered, as to have within the power of his army, without breach of the ceſſation by drawing neerer to their forces, any ſuch Citie, or ſo many, ſo rich, and ſo freſh Counties, as they have to retire into to that purpoſe. So that as nothing is more <hi>juſt</hi> in it ſelfe, and for his people, than ſuch a limitation; ſo nothing can be more unequall to His Majeſty, or more advantagious to them, than the admiſſion of, or connivence to any ſuch practiſes upon His people. This ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſation to begin on the 9. of <hi>April,</hi> and to continue to the end of 20. dayes, from the 25. of <hi>March.</hi> And His Majeſty deſires that the Treaty may proceed upon the Propoſitions in order, upon which His Majeſty hath an earneſt deſire, that a firm and ſtable peace may be agreed on, and both Armies ſpeedily disbanded; otherwiſe, if during this ceſſation, (in the Articles of which His Majeſty in order to peace, hath yeilded to things manifeſtly unreaſonable and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall to His Army) the Treaty be not diſpatched, His Majeſtie cannot without manifeſt ruine to His Army (principally that of the North) be able to contain Himſelf beyond this time now limited for the ceſſation, in the quarters in which He hath ſo long bin, and now is, and which will hardly be able to hold out ſo long, but muſt bee forced to remove, as He ſhall finde agreeable for His occaſions.</p>
               <p>And in caſe any delay be made in conſenting to theſe His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties limitations, or that the Houſes ſhall reject this His offer of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſation, His Majeſty as He hath lately deſired (by a Propoſition to both Houſes, delivered to their Committee, to which He hath yet recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no Anſwer) ſo He doth earneſtly continue to deſire, That the Treaty it ſelf may not be delayed or interrupted by it, but that their Committee may be enabled to proceed upon it in the mean while.</p>

               <p>IF the Comittee according to his Majeſties deſire had had but power to agree in the wording of expreſſions in the Articles of ceſſation,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:111010:23"/>His Majeſties (which are as cleer as the matter would bear, and as he could make them) had not appeared ſo doubtfull to any, but that the ceſſation might have bin ſuddenly &amp; ſpeedily reſolved, and that long before this time. And if the expreſſion of both Houſes in their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons had not neceſſitated his Majeſty in his own defence, to give ſuch anſwers as could not upon thoſe points deliver truth without ſome ſhew of ſharpnes, no expreſſion of that kind in his Majeſties anſwer had given any pretence for the rejection of, or refuſing ſo much as to treat upon this ceſſation, which (though it were at preſent for no long time) yet was from the day named by themſelves the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March;</hi> Whereas his Majeſty firſt mov'd for a Ceſſation and treaty without any limitation at all in the time of either, and his Majeſtie was moſt ready to have enlarg'd the time (ſo that in the meane while the point of quarters might be ſo ſetled, as that his Armies might ſubſiſt) and which might have beene (if they had pleaſ'd) a very good and promiſing earneſt, and fore-runner of that great bleſſing of Peace; for the obtaining of which, the wiſhes and endeavours of all good men being earneſtly bent, a farther debate in order to ſo great a benefit, did not deſerve to be ſtiled a conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time. And his Majeſty cannot but conceive himſelfe to be in a ſtrange condition, if the doubtfulneſſe of expreſſions (which muſt alwayes be whil'ſt the treaty is at ſuch a diſtance, and power is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to thoſe upon the place to helpe to cleere and explaine) or his neceſſary Replying to charges layd upon him (that hee might not ſeeme to acknowledge what was ſo charged) or the limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the time of ſeven dayes for the treaty (which was not limited by his Majeſty, who ever deſired to have avoyded that and other limitations which have given great interruptions to it) ſhould bee as well believed to bee the grounds, as they are made the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of the Rejection of that, which (next to Peace it ſelfe) his Majeſty above all things moſt deſires to ſee agreed and ſetled, and which his Majeſty hopes (if it may bee yet agreed on) will give his people ſuch a taſte of ſuch a bleſſing, that after a ſhort time of conſideration, and comparing of their ſeverall conditions in war and Peace, and what ſhould move them to ſuffer ſo much by a change, they will not thinke thoſe their friends that ſhall force them to it, or bee themſelves ready to contribute to the renewing of their former miſeries, without ſome greater evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of neceſſity than can appeare to them, when they ſhall have ſeen (as they ſhall ſee, if this treaty be ſuffered to proceed)
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:111010:24"/>That his Majeſty neither asks nor denies any thing, but what not only according to Law He may, but what in Honor and care of his people He is oblig'd to ask or deny. And this alone (which a very ſhort Ceſſation would produce) His Majeſty eſteems a very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable advantage to the Kingdom; And therfore cannot but preſſe again and again, that, what ever is thought doubtfull in the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Articles, may (as in an hour it may well be done) be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded; and whatſoever is excepted at, may be debated and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and that power and inſtructions may be given to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee to that end, That the miſerable effects of War, the effuſion of Engliſh bloud, and deſolation of <hi>England</hi> (untill they can bee totally taken away) may by this means be ſtaied and interrupted.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty ſuppoſes, That when the Committee was laſt requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to deſire his Majeſty to give a ſpeedy and poſitive Anſwer to the firſt Propoſition concerning disbanding; His Anſwers in that point (to which no Reply hath been made, and which He hopes by this time have given ſatisfaction) were not tranſmitted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: But wonders the Houſes ſhould preſſe his Majeſty for a ſpeedy and poſitive Anſwer, to the firſt part of their firſt Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning disbanding, when to the ſecond part of the very ſame Propoſition concerning his return to both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they had not given any power or inſtructions to the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, ſo much as to treat with his Majeſty. And when his Majeſty (if his deſire of peace, and of ſpeeding the treaty in order to that, had not been prevalent with him) might with all manner of Juſtice have delayed to begin to treat upon one part, untill they had beene enabled to treat upon the other; In which point, and for want of which power from them, the only ſtop now remains: His Majeſties Anſwers to both parts of their firſt Propoſition, being given in, tranſmitted, and yet remaining unanſwered.</p>
               <p>To which, untill the Houſes ſhall be at leiſure to make Anſwer, that as little delay in this Treaty as is poſſible may be cauſed by it; His Majeſty deſires likewiſe, That the Committee may be enabled to treat upon the following Propoſitions in their ſeverall orders.</p>

                  <p>HIs Majeſty knowes not what Proportion of his Revenue hath beene made uſe of by his two houſes of Parliament, but He hath reaſon to beleeve that if much of it hath not been uſed, very much remaines ſtill in their hands, His whole Revenue being ſo ſeized and ſtopped by the orders of one or both houſes, even to the taking away of his Money out of his Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer and Mint, and Bonds (forced from his Cofferers Clerkes) for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of his Majeſties houſhold, that very little hath come to his Maieſties uſe for his owne ſupport. He is well contented to allow whatſoever hath been imployed in the maintenance of his Children and to receive the Arreares due to himſelfe, and to be ſure of his owne for the future.</p>
                  <p>He is likewiſe willing to reſtore all Moneys taken for is Majeſties uſe by any Authority from him, upon any Bils aſſigned to other purpoſes; his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty being aſſured he hath received very little or nothing that way, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects that ſatisfaction be made for all thoſe ſeverall vaſt ſums received and diverted to other purpoſes, by orders of one or both houſes, which ought to have been paid upon the Act of Pacification to his Subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> or imployed for the diſcharge of the debts of this Kingdom, and by other Acta of Parliament for the reliefe of his poore Proteſtant Subjects of <hi>Ireland.</hi>

And he is very ſorry that both houſes of Parliament have not thought fit to enlarge the power of the Committee, (whereby leſſe time would have ſerved for the Treaty) and are ſo abſolutely reſolved not to enlarge the time of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

                  <p>We did according to our Inſtructions, humbly deſire Your Majeſty that the Cinqueports, Forts and Caſtles might be put into the hands of ſuch No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſons, and perſons of Quality and truſt, to be nominated by Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, as the two houſes of Parliament ſhould confide in, and to be kept for Your Majeſties ſervice, and the ſafety of the Kingdome, that no forraigne for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or other forces, raiſed without Your Majeſties authority, and conſent of the two houſes of Parliament, ſhould be admitted into any of them, and the Commanders to uſe their utmoſt endeavours to ſuppreſſe all Forces raiſed without ſuch authority and conſent, and to ſeize all Armes and Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on provided for any ſuch Forces.</p>

                  <p>AS his Majeſtie was and is very deſirous to receive any Reaſon from both Houſes, or their Committee, which might induce his Majeſtie to give other Anſwers, if what he hath or ſhall give, doe not ſatisfie, ſo he rather expected thoſe reaſons ſhould have had their foundation in the Law of the land, and have ſhewed him that by Law he had not the Right be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, or that by that, or by ſome fundamentall Law, they had a Right ſuperiour to his in what was now in queſtion, or have ſhewed him ſome Legall reaſon why the perſons truſted by him were incapable of that truſt, then onely have inſiſted upon Feares and Jealouſies, of which as hee knows not the ground, ſo he is ignorant of the Cure. But this his Majeſty knows, that if readineſſe to acknowledge, retract and provide againſt for the future any thing of errour that had hapned againſt Law, and having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually paſſed more important Bills, and parted with more of his known Rights for the ſatisfaction of his Subjects, then not onely any one but all his Predeceſſors, would have been thought a ſufficient remedy for Feares and Jealouſies, the Kingdom might ſtill have enjoyed a ſafe, firme, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Peace, and thoſe would not firſt have been made a reaſon to ſeize upon his Rights, and then after have been made an Argument to perſwade him to part with them. And his Majeſtie wonders the Committee ſhould not ſee, that this Argument might extend to the depriving him of, or at leaſt ſharing with him in, all his juſt Regall power (ſince Power as well as For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may be the object of Feares and Jealouſies, and there will be alwayes a power left to hurt, whileſt there is any left to protect and defend;) And that if thoſe Rights which he received from his Predeceſſours were really
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:111010:33"/>ſo formidable, That would have beene more feared before, which is now feared ſo much, and his Forts and Caſtles would either not have been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, or at leaſt have enabled him to defend and keep them, and have kept this from being a Queſtion now between them. Which ſince they could not do, his Majeſtie (if he had as much inclination, as he hath more right, to Feares and Jelouſies) might have more reaſon to inſiſt upon ſome addition of Power, as a ſecurity to enable him to keepe his Forts, when he hath them, then they to make any diffcultie to reſtore them to him in the ſame condition they were before. But as his Majeſty contents himſelfe with, ſo, he takes God to witneſſe, his greateſt deſire is alwaies to obſerve and maintain the Law of the Land, and expects the ſame from his Subjects, and beleeves the mutuall obſervance of that rule, and neither of them to feare what the Law fears not, to be on both parts a better cure for that dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous diſeaſe of Fears and Jealouſies, and a better means to eſtabliſh a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and a perpetuall Peace, then for his Majeſtie to deveſt himſelfe of thoſe truſts which the Law of the Land hath ſetled in the Crowne alone, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the power and dignity of the Prince, for the better protection of the Subject, and of the Law, and to avoid thoſe dangerous diſtractions which the intereſt of any Sharers with him would have infallibly produced.</p>

                  <p>HIs Majeſtie gave ſo cleare a reaſon to juſtifie what he inſiſted upon in the point of the Ships, that he cannot but wonder to ſee the ſame againe preſt to him, and yet both the reaſon he gave, left unanſwered, and no other Reaſon oppoſed to weigh againſt it. His Majeſties end in this, was not to lay any cenſure upon their proceedings, but it being neceſſary to the matter in Queſtion, for his Majeſtie to ſay what had been done, and the matter of fact be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch, as it ſeems could not be repeated, but it muſt appeare to bee cenſured; his Majeſtie did not thinke himſelfe bound to bee ſo tender of ſeeming to cenſure their proceedings, as by waving his own true reaſonable Juſtifications, to leave his owne naked and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to a generall cenſure. And his Majeſtie hopes, that ſince they eſteem his ſaying, that they have taken his Ships from him contrary to Law to be a Cenſure, they will either produce that Law by which they tooke them, or free themſelves from ſo juſt and unconfutable a cenſure, by a ſpeedie and unlimited reſtoration. Upon which demand, his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties care of his ancient and undoubted Rights, doth oblige him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. And when his Maieſtie ſhall thinke fit to make an Admirall, as neere as he can, he ſhall be ſuch an one, againſt whom no iuſt exception can be made, and if any ſhall be offered, he will readily leave him to the triall of the Law.</p>

               <p>HIs Majeſty doth acknowledge to have received a Paper from the Committee upon the tenth of <hi>April,</hi> expreſſing, That they had received Inſtructions, to declare unto His Majeſty the deſire of both Houſes for His Majeſties coming to His Parliament, which they had often expreſt with full offers of ſecurity to His Royall Perſon, agreeable to their Duty and Allegiance; and that they know no cauſe why His Majeſty might not return thither with honour and ſafety. But as the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee had before acknowledged in a Paper of the ſixth of <hi>April,</hi> not to have any power or Inſtructions to treat with His Majeſty concerning His Return to His two Houſes of Parliament, and as this Paper mentioned no Inſtructions to treat, but only to deliver that ſingle Meſſage concerning it, ſo His Majeſty took it for granted, that if they had received any new power or Inſtructions in that point, they would have ſignified as much to Him, and therefore conceiving it in vain to diſcourſe, and impoſſible to treat upon that, with thoſe, who had no power to treat with Him, His Majeſty addreſt that Anſwer concerning that point to both Houſes, of which His Majeſty took notice to the Committee in a Paper of the ſeventh of <hi>April,</hi> and which was ſhewed to them before He ſent it. And if both Houſes will upon it but conſent, to give His Majeſty ſuch ſecurity as will appear to all indifferent Perſons to be agreeable to their Duty and Allegiance (thoſe Tumults which drove Him from thence, and what followed thoſe Tumults, being a moſt viſible and ſufficient reaſon why He cannot Return thither with His Honour and Safety, without more particular offers of ſecurity, then as yet they have ever made Him) all diſputes about that point between them, will be ſoon ended, and his Majeſty ſpeedily return to them, and His whole Kingdom to their former Peace and Happyneſſe.</p>

               <p>DEar Heart, Saturday and Sunday laſt, I received two from thee, of the 29 of <hi>December,</hi> 9 of <hi>January,</hi> both which, gave me ſuch contentment, as thou mayeſt better judge, then I deſcribe; the which, that thou mayeſt the better do, know, I was full three weeks wanting but one day, without hearing from thee; beſides, skurvy <hi>London</hi> news of thy ſtay and lameneſſe, which though I did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, yet it vext me ſo much the more, that I could not prove them lyars; So now I conjure thee by the Affections thou beareſt me, not only to judge, but likewiſe participate with me in the contentment thou haſt given me by aſſuring me of thy health and ſpeedy return, concerning 45. 31. 7. 4. 132. 300. I will anſwer thee in thy own words, <hi>Je le remetteray a vous reſpondre per bouche,</hi> being confident that way to give thee contentment; in the mean time aſſure thy Self, That I neither have, nor will looſe any time in that buſineſſe, and that I have not contented my Self with Generalls; and though I hope ſhortly to have the happyneſſe of thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, yet I muſt tell thee of ſome particulars, in which, I deſire both thy opinion and aſſiſtance: I am perſecuted concerning places, and all deſire to be put upon thee, the which I cannot blame them; and yet thou knoweſt I have no reaſon to do it, <hi>Newarke</hi> deſireth <hi>Savills</hi> place, upon condition, to leave it when his father dyeth; <hi>Carenworth,</hi> the ſame being contented to pay for it, or give the profit to whom, or how I pleaſe; <hi>Digby</hi> and <hi>Dunſmore,</hi> for to the Captain of the Pentioners, <hi>Hartford</hi> once looked after it; but now I beleeve he expects either to be Treaſurer, or of my Bed-chamber; I incline rather to the latter if thou like it, for I abſolutely hold <hi>Cottington</hi> the fitteſt man for the other. There is one that doth not yet pretend, that doth deſerve as well as any, Im an <hi>Capell;</hi> therefore I deſire thy aſſiſtance to finde ſomewhat for him before he ask. One place I muſt fill before I can have thy opinion, It is the Maſter of the Wards; I have thought upon <hi>Nicholas,</hi> being confident that thou wilt not miſlike my choice; and if he cannot performe both, <hi>Ned Hyde</hi> muſt be Secretary, for indeed, I can truſt no other. Now I have no more time to ſpeak of more, but to deſire thee not to engage thy Self for any;</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Lords and Commons aſſembled in Parliament, being deeply afflicted with a ſorrowfull ſence of miſerable diſtractions of this Kingdom, overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the calamities of the worſt kinde of War, have by ſeverall Petitions and many humble Addreſſes to His Majeſtie, beſought him by remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the cauſes thereof, to put an end thereunto: And although all their endeavours have not onely proved fruitleſſe, but ſome of their Petitions received a deniall even of Audience, (a favour not denied to the Rebels of <hi>Ireland</hi>) which might very well juſtifie them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and man, to decline any further proſecution that way, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in a caſe where themſelves and the kingdom are the parties injured and oppreſſed: Yet their bowels did ſo much yearn after a happy peace, that they reſolved, notwithſtanding their former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, to break thorow all difficulties; And yet once more moſt humbly to repreſent to His Majeſtie the miſerable diſtempers of His two Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and if poſſibly they could to endline His Royall heart, really to act what he hath ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten verbally profeſſed, <hi>To compoſe thoſe unhappy diſtractions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore His people to a bleſſed and laſting Peace.</hi> And for that purpoſe, about the firſt of February laſt, They in all humbleneſſe preſented their deſires to His Majeſtie, digeſted into fourteen Propoſitions, and how reaſonable and indifferent thoſe Propoſitions were, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to the view of the world to judge, reſting aſſured that no indifferent man that ſhall duely weigh them, with the time and circumſtance, will finde any thing contained in them, but what was neceſſary for the maintenance and advancement of <hi>The true Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, The due execution of juſtice, The preſervation of the Liberty and Property of the Subject,</hi> and <hi>The eſtabliſhment of the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:111010:41"/>Kingdoms Peace and ſafety.</hi> And becauſe they might with all ſpeed take off the burthen under which this Kingdom did principally groan, and ſtop the ſpring from whence moſt of theſe calamities did ſlow; They in the firſt place propounded, <hi>That the Armies and Forces raiſed on both ſides might be disbanded,</hi> which being effected, the Kingdom might with the more eaſe and ſecurity expect the iſſue of the Treaty. And therefore they were very carefull, that no Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition or circumſtance touching the Treaty ſhould precede this.</p>
            <p>His Majeſtie having received and conſidered theſe Propoſitions, he not long after returned his Anſwer, wherein he Profeſſeth to have <hi>given up all the faculties of his ſoul to an earneſt endeavour of a Peace and reconciliation with his people,</hi> and deſires a ſpeedy time and place might be agreed upon, for the meeting of ſuch perſons, as His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie and both Houſes ſhould appoint to diſcuſſe thoſe Propoſitions; and ſix other Propoſitions made by His, Majeſtie, and ſent with that Anſwer; whereof one was, <hi>That to the intent the Treaty might not ſuffer interruption by any intervening accidents, That a Ceſſation of Arms and free Trade might be firſt agreed upon;</hi> which Anſwer the Lords and Commons did take into their conſideration: And becauſe His Majeſtie did deſire that a Ceſſation might be firſt agreed upon, they did accordingly ſubmit thereunto, though they had purpoſely avoided it before; being unwilling to waſte the time about the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow that would of it ſelf vaniſh with the disbanding, which they deſired might be concluded in the firſt place.</p>
            <p>But they were willing to give all ſatisfaction to His Majeſties deſires, hoping thereby to incline him the more readily to conſent to their juſt requeſts. And according to their reſolution, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared ready the Articles of Ceſſation, and that with as much equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and indifferency to both ſides as poſſibly they could. They like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe agreed to Treat upon the Propoſitions before the Disbanding; in which Treaty, ſo much of His Majeſties Propoſitions as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned His Majeſties Revenue, Magazines, Forts, and Ships, and the Propoſitions of both Houſes for the Disbanding, ſhould be firſt Treated of, and concluded, before the proceeding to Treat upon any other. And that this Treaty ſhould begin the fourth of March, or ſooner if it might be; and that from the beginning of the Treaty, the time might not exceed twenty dayes.

            <p>All which their reſolutions they forthwith by a Meſſenger diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched for that purpoſe preſented to His Majeſtie, and not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſent a Committee to attend him. And though they hoped for a ready concurrence from His Majeſtie to the Articles of Ceſſation, the Propoſition proceeding from himſelf, yet they received a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, much contrary to their expectation, where they found many ſcruples raiſed, and other Articles propounded, which being aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto by them, would inevitably deſtroy the Forces raiſed by them for <hi>The defence of themſelves, their Religion, and Liberty,</hi> and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the Malignant and Popiſh Army raiſed againſt them; which they made appear by their humble Anſwer to thoſe Alterations and Articles which are herewith at large publiſhed, and therefore do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre themſelves thereunto. And in the interim, while His Majeſty was conſidering of this their humble Anſwer, they gave power to their Committee to Treat upon the two firſt Propoſitions for four dayes, which after wards they enlarged to the end of twenty dayes. And within ſome diſtance of time afterwards, they received a very long Meſſage from His Majeſtie, which (indeed) carried not with it the face or ſemblance of a Treaty, but in plain down right lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, was <hi>a bitter Invective againſt the two houſes of Parliament, and their proceedings;</hi> ſo that by this time it might very well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, <hi>That the enemies of the Kingdoms peace, ſo really proſecuted, and likely to be effected by the earneſt endeavours of both Houſes, thought it high time to caſt in their tares of ſedition, to prevent the growth of ſo bleſſed a fruit.</hi> In this Meſſage, after very heavy Taxes, and unjuſt Scandals and Accuſations laid to their charge, forced in, quite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the queſtion. His Majeſtie condiſcended to the Ceſſation in manner as was agreed on, by both Houſes, to continue onely for five dayes, expecting a liberty notwithſtanding to be given the Committee <hi>to word it according to the reall Intention,</hi> and ſo that His Majeſtie might not be underſtood to conſent to any Impoſing upon Leavying, Diſtraining, or Impriſoning of His Subjects, to force them to Contribute, expreſly proteſting againſt it, and Inhibiting his Subjects to ſubmit thereunto, and requiring them to reſiſt; and ſo that there might not be a liberty for Seizing upon his Subjects by any Souldiers of the Army, for not ſubmitting to ſuch Impoſitions: Which offer of His Majeſties, being but a Ceſſation onely for five dayes, and ſome part of that time to be firſt ſpent by the Committee
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:111010:42"/>in wording of it, and limited with a Proteſtation againſt, and a Command to reſiſt that Power whereby their Forces muſt be paid and ſupported, which if not anſwered and juſtified, would by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to His Majeſties offer, imply a declining of that power, which might indanger the Disbanding of their Army; And if anſwered, would neceſſarily have enforced them to ſome ſharpneſſe of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, which the enemics of this Treaty would eaſily take occaſion to quarrel at, and perſwade His Majeſtie to break off; which the Lord and Commons, out of their hearty zeal to bring it to a happy concluſion, did purpoſely avoid. and therefore they did not onely paſſely theſe Scandals, and unjuſt Accuſations laid to their charge by that Meſſage, but purpoſely declined to enter into any diſpute of their power, for maintaining the Forces raiſed for their own neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary defence. And therefore thought it beſt to ſpend the remainder of the time in Treating upon the Propoſitions, and for that end enjoyned their Committee, as much as in them lay, to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten it, eſpecially that part touching the Disbanding, which being concluded, would not only produce a temporary Ceſſation, but an abſolute abolition of all acts of hoſtility. The proceedings and iſſue of which Treaty, the Lords and Commons think it neceſſary to publiſh to the Kingdom, to the end the ſincerity of their endeavours, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a happy ſettlement of theſe miſerable diſtractions may appear.</p>
            <p>When they perceived that the moſt part of the time preſcribed for the Treaty was like to be ſpent about the Ceſſation, they gave power to their Committee in the mean time, to Treat upon the Propoſitions in order as they had formerly Voted, and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with His Majeſties firſt Propoſition, whereby. His Majeſtie demanded, <hi>That his own Revenue, Magazines, Towns, Forts and Ships, which had bin taken or kept from him by force, ſhould be forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with reſtored unto him.</hi> The Lords and Commons by their Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, made him this humble Anſwer. Firſt, <hi>That as to his Revenue they had not made uſe of it but in a ſmall proportion, and a good part of that was imployed for the maintenance of his own children, according to the allowance eſtabliſhed by himſelf, that what ſhould remain due to His Majeſtie they would ſatisfie, and would leave the ſame to His Majeſtie for the time to come.</hi> They likewiſe thereupon propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to His Majeſtie, <hi>That he would reſtore what had been taken for his uſe, upon any of the Bills aſſigned to other purpoſes, by ſeverall Acts of Parliament, as out of the proviſion made for the Wars of Ireland,</hi> which offer of theirs, after ſome debate thereupon with
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:111010:42"/>the Committee, was thought reaſonable, and in effect concluded. And as to the Demand of the Towns, Forts, and Ships, they in ſubſtance gave this humble anſwer; <hi>That they would deliver up ſuch as remained in their hands, into the hands of ſuch perſons of worth, qualitie, and truſt, to be nominated by His Majeſtie as the two Houſes of Parliament ſhould confide in, none of which perſons to be removed during three yeers next enſuing, without juſt cauſe to be approved of by both Houſes. That the Warden of the Cinque-Ports, and all governours and Commanders of Towns, Forts, and Caſtles, ſhould keep the ſame reſpectively, for the ſervice of his Majeſtie, and the ſafetie of the Kingdom, and that they ſhould not admit into them any Forraign Forces, or any other Forces raiſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out His Majeſties authoritie, and conſent of the two Houſes of Parliament. And they ſhould uſe their uttermoſt indeavours to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe all Forces raiſed without ſuch authoritie and conſent, and ſeize all Armes and Ammunition provided for any ſuch Forces.</hi> Unto which Offer of theirs His Majeſtie gave this concluſive Anſwer: <hi>That His Majeſtie did not intend that both Houſes of Parliament ſhould expreſſe their confidence of the perſons to whoſe truſt the Cinque-Ports,</hi>
               <note place="margin">April 5.</note> 
               <hi>or other His Majesties Townes and Forts, were or ſhould be committed, but that they ſhould have libertie to proceed againſt them according to Law;</hi> His Majeſtie claiming the nomination and free election to belong to him of right. And to the Clauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the admiſſion of Forces into thoſe Forts, Caſtles, and Towns; His Majeſtie would conſent no further then theſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall tearms; That is, <hi>That no Forces raiſed or brought in, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Law ſhould be admitted, and that all Arms and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition ſhould be ſei<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed upon, which by the Lawes and Statutes of the Kingdom they ought to ſeize.</hi> They made the like Anſwer concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ships, <hi>That they ſhould be delivered into the hands of ſuch noble Perſon as His Majestie ſhould nominate to be Lord high Admirall of</hi> England, <hi>and the two Houſes of Parliament confide in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which offer His Majeſty refuſed His conſent, declaring His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to inſiſt upon what by Law was His own (as His Majeſty was pleaſed to expreſſe it,) and take from Him ſhould be reſtored unto Him without any conditioning, or new lymitations to be put upon Him or His Miniſters. And now the Lords and Commons will referre it to the world to judge, whither their demands were not ſuch, and ſo moderate, as was fit and neceſſary for them to make, and juſt and reaſonable for His Majeſty to aſſent unto: wherein they may be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:111010:43"/>to conſider, That this was a Treaty for the disbanding of two Armies, and Forces raiſed in oppoſition each to other. That the Towns, Forts, and Ships, are a great part of theſe Forces, and of the ſtrength of that ſide, that poſſeſſeth them: That for any one ſide to demand the poſſeſſion and power thereof, and the other ſide to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band their forces, and quit themſelves of all their ſtrength is in effects a totall disbanding of that ſide, and a continuing the forces of the other, which muſt be granted to be moſt unequall; And therefore the Lords and Commons did think it juſt and honourable, That the remaining ſtrength ſhould be put into ſuch hands, as both ſides might truſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That their demand to have the Forts and Caſtles into the hands of ſuch perſons as both Houſes ſhould confide in, was a Propoſition warranted by the frequent<note n="*" place="margin">

                  </p>
               </note> Preſidents of former times,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:111010:43"/>whereby it appeareth, that many other Parliaments have made the like and greater demands, and His Majeſties Predeceſſors have aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereunto.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It was a Propoſition which his Majeſtie himſelf in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Declarations of his own affirmed to be reaſonable and juſt; for in his Majeſties Anſwer to a Petition of the houſe of Commons, <hi>January</hi> 28.1641. <hi>He</hi> He expreſſeth thus, For the Forts and Caſtles of the Kingdom, his Majeſtie is reſolved, they ſhall be in ſuch hands, and onely in ſuch as the Parliament may ſafely confide in, &amp;c. And in another Anſwer to two Petitions of the Lords and Commons, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the ſecond of <hi>February,</hi> 1641. His Majeſty uſeth theſe words, <hi>That, for the ſecuring you from all dangers or Jealouſies of any</hi>) <hi>His Majeſties, will be content to put in all the places, both of Forts and Militia, in the ſevarall Counties. ſuch perſons as both Houſes of Paliament ſhall either aprove or recommend unto Him, So that you declare before unto His Majeſty the name of the perſons whom you approve or recommend, unleſſe ſuch perſons ſhall be named, againſt whom he ſhall have juſt and unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable exception;</hi> which being declared by His Majeſty Himſelf they had no cauſe to ſuſpect a deniall, being confident, that His Majeſty did intend what he ſpoke; and if any ill Counſell could prevail to make Him recede from His word, it muſt be admitted the Kingdom hath more cauſe to be further ſecured.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, For that to our ſad experience, it is well known, That His Majeſties power in this and other things, is too much ſteered and guided by the advice of theſe ſecret and wicked Councellors, that have been the Inſtruments of our preſent miſeries; And though His Majeſty carryeth the name, yet they will have the diſpoſing of thoſe places; And the Lords and Commons thought it the more reaſonable and neceſſary to inſiſt thereupon, Becauſe that in the time when they were preparing their Propoſitions to His Majeſty, it did appear unto them by a Letter written by His Majeſty to the Queen, (which they have cauſed to be here with Printed) that the great and eminent places of the Kingdom were diſpoſed by her advice and power, and what Her Religion is, and conſequently how preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent the Councells of Papiſts and Jeſuites will be with Her, may be eaſily conjectured; and it is to be obſerved who the perſons deſigned for preferment were, even during the ſitting of a Parliament. The Lord <hi>Digby</hi> impeached in Parliament for high Treaſon, and moſt, if not all the reſt impeached in Parliament, and ſuch as bear Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>
            <pb n="84" facs="tcp:111010:44"/>
            <p> Laſtly, admitting that theſe demands touching the Ships and Forts had been made even in a time of Peace and tranquility, yet conſidering the attempts of Force and Violence made and practiſed againſt the Kingdom, and this preſent Parliament; as the Deſignes many years ſince to bring to this Kingdom the <hi>German Horſe,</hi> to compell the Subject to ſubmit to an arbitrary Government; The indeavour to bring up the late <hi>Northerne Armie,</hi> by force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to awe the Parliament; His Majeſtie coming in perſon to the Houſe of Comments, accompanied with many Armed men, to demand their Members to be delivered up; And the Treaſon of the Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> to bring over the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Popiſh Armie to Conquer the Kingdom; they might very well juſtifie, nay they were in dutie bound (in diſcharge of the truſt repoſed in them by the Common-wealth) to make that Demand, and expect the performance thereof, to the end the people might be ſecured from any ſuch violence hereafter, yet (to their inexpreſsible ſorrow they muſt ſpeak it) neither the Reaſonableneſſe the Moderation, or Juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Requeſt, nor the Peace of the Kingdom (which probably would enſue thereupon, could be Arguments prevalent enough to induce His Majeſties cons;ent thereunto; and His Majeſties offer of thoſe Commanders that ſhall offend, to leave them to Juſtice and Triall of the Law, is an Anſwer more to ſhew His power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect Delinquents then ſatisfaction to a Parliament, being the due and right of the meaneſt Subject; and yet intituled here as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour done to both Houſes of Parliament.</p>
            <p>And though His Majeſtie is pleaſed to juſtifie His deniall, with the Allegation, <hi>That it is His right by Law;</hi> they muſt appeal to the judgement of all indifterent men, whether that be a ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ground of refuſall, for admitting His Majeſties power of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Ships, Forts, and Caſtles, and committing them into what hands He pleaſe, to be by Law abſolutely veſted in His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie (which they by no means can admit, He being onely truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them for <hi>The defence and ſafetie of the Kingdom</hi>) as He ſon, for the King to refuſe His conſent to after that Law, when by circumſtance of time and affairs, that power becomes deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to the Common-wealth and ſafetie of the people: The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation whereof, is the chief end of the Law, and though the two Houſes of Parliament, being the repreſentative body of the Kingdom, are the moſt competent Judges thereof, yet in this
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:111010:44"/>Caſe they do not proceed onely upon an implicite Faith, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate it both by Reaſon and Experience, <hi>That their demand is not only necceſſary to ſecure the Kingdom from Fear and Jealouſie, but to preſerve it even from ruine and deſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſurely had this Argument of being <hi>Their right by Law,</hi> been prevailing with His Majeſtie Precedeſſours, this Nation ſhould have wanted many an Act of Parliament which now they have, that was neceſſary for their being and ſubſiſtence. And they coul heartily wiſh that the Lawes and Statutes of the Kingdom might be <hi>The rule of what is, and what is not to be done,</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging with His Majeſtie, that the ſame is the onely rule between Him and His people, the aſſurance of the free enjoyment thereof is their onely aime; but how little fruit the people hath gathered from this true, let the wofull experience of theſe laſt eighteen yeers judge, where, in a time of Peace and Plentie, the power of iſſuing out Commiſſions, to compell Loanes; A power in the King at His pleaſure to impoſe a charge upon the people, to provide Ships, without limitation of time or proportion; A power in the Councell Board to commit men, and determine buſineſſe without diſtinction of perſons or cauſes; The power of laying Impoſition, both upon Forreign and Domeſticke Commodities, and many other Acts of oppreſſions, was under the name and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of a <hi>Legall right thereunto,</hi> practiſed and put in execution; Againſt which, the Subject had no help of relief, but neceſſitated to ſubmit and lie under the burden: And when at any time a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was called (being the onely cure and remedie for theſe griefs) it could no ſooner touch upon theſe ſores, but it was daſhed in pieces by a ſudden diſlolution. And now that a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die is provided for that miſchief, by the Act for continance of this Parliament, it is attempted by the force and power of an Army to effect that which formerly could have been done with more eaſe and readineſſe.</p>
            <p>And now they referre it to the cenſure of any honeſt man, whether they have not the warrant of Reaſon and Neceſſitie, to demand ſome ſecuritie to enjoy that which His Majeſtie confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to be the peoples right: And in reference to that, whether their Demand of having the Forts, Caſtles, and Shipping to be put into ſuch hand as both Houſes ſhall have cauſe to confide in, was not both moderate and reaſonable.</p>
            <p>And touching their Demand, and His Majeſties Anſwer to the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:111010:45"/>Clauſe concerning the admiſſion of Forces into thoſe Forts, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and Towns, they muſt ſtill ſubmit it to all indifferent judgements, how much reaſon and juſtice was comprehended in their Demand, and how little ſatisfaction they received therein: His Majeſty anſwers, <hi>That no Forces raiſed or brought in contrary to Law, ſhould be admitted;</hi> which they could heartily wiſh here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore had, or hereafter would be really performed: But they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it may be conſidered, What ſecurity this will be to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to prevent the raiſing or bringing in of Forces contrary to Law; who ſhall be Judges of the Law, when thoſe Forces are once raiſed, and once brought in? Surely His Majeſty will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the two Houſes of Parliament to be; for His Majeſty by ſeverall Declarations, hath expreſly denyed them any ſuch power: For contrary to their Declarations, fortified with Law and reaſon, His Majeſty publiſhed and affirmed the legallity of the Commiſſion of <hi>Array,</hi> and put the ſame in execution in moſt parts of the Kingdom; Hath authorized the Papiſts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to take Arms to oppoſe the Parliament, and their Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and to rob, ſpoyl, and deprive the Proteſtants of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of their eſtates and lives; Hath by divers Proclamations and Declarations publiſhed the raiſing of Forces, and taking up of Arms by the two Houſes of Parliament, and ſuch as therein obey their Commands, for their own defence, and the defence of their Religion and Liberty aſſaulted by an Army of Papiſts, and their adherents, to be Rebellion and Treaſon; and the taking up of Arms by the Papiſts and their adherents, to be acts of duty and loyalty; And all this urged and pretended to be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the Law of the Land: And they do not doubt, but by the ſame Law, perſons legally impeached and accuſed in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of high Treaſon; as the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> Maſter <hi>Percy,</hi> Maſter <hi>Jermyn,</hi> Maſter <hi>Oneale,</hi> and others, are by the Power of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my protected from the Juſtice of the Parliament: And yet all this while the people have not onely his Majeſties promiſe, but His Oath, to govern and protect them according to the Laws of the Land. And now they appeal to the world, Whether ſuch a generall Anſwer, <hi>That no Forces raiſed or brought in contrary to Law,</hi> without admitting them ſo much as to declare their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the perſons that are to be entruſted with the Power, be juſt or reaſonable: What is it otherwiſe in effect, then to make thoſe perſons that are the Inſtruments to violate the Law, Judges
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:111010:45"/>of that Law (which to our ſad experience, is the wofull and miſerable preſent condition of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And though, by what had hitherto paſſed, they had little cauſe to ſuſpect ſuch a happy iſſue to the Treaty as they heartily wiſhed, and moſt earneſtly laboured for, diſcovering not the leaſt inclination of complyance to their juſt Demands, but all, or moſt of them, anſwered with a denyall, and that not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome ſharpneſſe and acrimony; yet reſolving to be wanting in nothing of their parts, they enjoyned their Committee to preſſe on the Propoſition for disbanding, and humbly deſire His Majeſties poſitive Anſwer thereunto; which (if aſſented unto by His Majeſty) would, though not wholly take away the cauſe, and perfectly cure the diſtractions of this Kingdom, yet at leaſt take off the ſmart and pain under which both Church and State do moſt miſerably languiſh, and ſo better enable them to endure the expectation of a thorow Cure.</p>
            <p>The Committee applyed themſelves to His Majeſty accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; and after ſome endeavour to protract the debate of this Propoſition, and deſire that it might be deferred to the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Treaty; and that the time of the Treaty might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, His Majeſty being earneſtly importuned to a poſitive and ſpeedy Anſwer, to the end the Kingdom might know what they might truſt to, His Majeſty was pleaſed to return this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; That as ſoon as His Majeſty were ſatisfied in His firſt Propoſition, concerning His own Revenue, Magazines, Ships, and Forts. Secondly, as ſoon as all the Members of both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſhall be reſtored to the ſame capacity of ſitting and voting in Parliament, as they had upon the firſt of <hi>January,</hi> 1641, not intending to extend it to the Biſhops Votes, or to ſuch in whoſe places, upon new Writs, new Elections have been made. Thirdly, as ſoon as His Majeſty and both Houſes might be ſecured from ſuch tumultuous aſſemblies as formerly aſſembled about both Houſes; which ſecurity, His Majeſtly explains, can be onely ſetled by adjourning the Parliament to ſome place twenty miles from <hi>London,</hi> His Majeſty would conſent that both the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſhould be disbanded, and come to the Parliament; which in terms plain enough, is as much to ſay. That untill both Houſes ſhall conſent to thoſe demands, he will not disband His Army, He will continue the Warre: And what reaſon or juſtice is either in the

               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:111010:47"/>matter or manner of thoſe demands; Or what hope or expectation the people can have to ſee an end of their preſent calamities, they leave it to themſelves to judge. His Majeſty in the beginning of the Treaty, in His anſwer to the Propoſitions of both Houſes, was pleaſed to expreſſe how unparliamentary it was by Arms to require new Laws: but how to apply that the two Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they muſt confeſſe they are to ſeek; they never having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded any new Laws by Arms, endeavouring onely (what in them lieth) to preſerve and defend themſelves, their Religion, and Laws, from the violence of an Army firſt raiſed againſt them; which being laid down and disbanded, they offer to disband theirs, without any other condition. But they are well aſſured, That by this His Majeſties Anſwer, here is not onely a requiring of new Laws, but a repealing of the old, by Arms: For His Majeſty muſt have this Parliament adjourned to another place; which by a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute made this preſent Parliament, cannot be done, without the conſent of both Houſes. He muſt have the Members diſabled to ſit there by the reſpective judgement of both Houſes, reſtored to their former capacity of ſitting and voting, or he will not conſent to disband. And how deſtructive to the Liberties of the Parliament, and dangerous to the Kingdom theſe Conditions required by His Majeſty to precede the disbanding, are, any man that hath an eye to ſee, may eaſily diſcern: As firſt, To ſatisfie his firſt Propoſition, in yeelding up the Magazines, Ships, and Forts, into the hands of ſuch perſons as His Majeſtie ſhall appoint to receive the ſame, without any admiſſion to the two Houſes to expreſſe their confidence in thoſe perſons: which being performed, were to yeeld up the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall part, if not all the ſtrength they have, and expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, Religion, and the Kingdom, to the mercy of a powerfull Popiſh Army raiſed againſt them; and ſubmit it to them, and to the will and pleaſure of thoſe Councellors, whoſe intereſt with His Majeſty, hath brought this Kingdom to this deſolate condition, whether they would disband or not. Secondly, To ſatisfie Him in His Propoſition touching His Revenue, wherein He demands a reſtitution of what hath been taken from Him: Which (though it would prove no conſiderable Sum, yet the time that the examination and agreement upon the accompt, would neceſſarily take up, would prove ſuch, as might very well make the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſink under the burden of two Armies, before it came to a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:111010:47"/>concluſion. And touching His Majeſties requiring a reſtitution of the Members to their ſitting, and Votes; It is obſervable that the demand is made, without diſtinction of perſons, or offences; ſo that be the perſons never ſo criminous, or the offences never ſo notorious, and ſo the Judgement never ſo juſt, yet all muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, or no conſent to disbanding. And the reaſon and ground of the Demand is as obſervable; Becauſe they adhered to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty in theſe diſtractions: An Argument, they muſt confeſſe, much uſed by the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> in defence of his Treaſon, who would have juſtified the moſt notorious Crimes laid to his charge, by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Commands derived from His Majeſty, and his zeal to advance His Majeſties Service and profit: and no doubt the ſame reaſon may be uſed for the Judges, in caſe of Ship-money, and moſt of the Monopoliſts and Projectors, who by Letters Patents had not onely His Majeſties Command and Authority for the doing what they did, but brought in great Sums of Money to His uſe and benefit, and that perhaps in times of neceſſity and want there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: And ſo conſequently, becauſe theſe adhered to His Majeſty, (for what they did, was for his profit) with the like reaſon it may be required, That all Impeachments and Proceedings againſt them ſhould be repealed, and laid aſide.</p>
            <p>And ſurely nothing can be more deſtructive and dangerous both to Parliament and Kingdom, then the conſenting to that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: For what can be more deſtructive to both Houſes, then to reſtore thoſe perſons to have their former ſuffrage and Votes in Parliament, over the lives and Liberties of the People, and the Priviledge of Parliament, who have not onely diſſerted the Parliament, diſobeyed and contemned their Authority, neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Truſt repoſed in them by thoſe that ſent them thither, in whoſe behalf they were to attend and ſerve there, but by private practiſes and open hoſtility have endeavoured to deſtroy both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and people.</p>
            <p>And it would be an objection of difficultie to anſwer, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in giving a conſent to this demand, the people who are to chuſe theſe Members ſhould not be deprived of their intereſt and freedom of choice and election now divolved unto them, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out the Members already ſent; And to this they might adde, the danger of the Preſident, and the reflection of diſhonour that would fall upon both Houſes, ſhould they conſent to this which
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:111010:48"/>would be with the ſame breath, as it were, to give and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal their judgement, and pronounce ſentence of injuſtice and raſhneſſe againſt themſelves; but they will not inſiſt thereupon in a caſe otherwiſe ſo full of danger and inconveniencie to the publique.</p>
            <p>And touching the Propoſition of adjourning the Parliament twenty miles diſtant from <hi>London,</hi> they ſhall not need in a caſe ſo apparant, to ſpend many words to diſcover the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and unreaſonableneſſe thereof, for, ſhould they aſſent unto it, to paſſe over the inconveniencies that would happen to ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that ſhould have occaſion to attend the Parliament, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving it ſo far from the reſidencie of the ordinary Courts of Juſtice, and the places where the Records of the Kingdom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main (whereof there is frequent uſe to be made) it would not onely give a tacite conſent to thoſe ſcandals ſo often preſſed and affirmend in ſeverall Declarations, That is, That His Majeſtie was forced for the ſafetie of His own perſon heretofore to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, and hitherto to abſent himſelf from the Parliament, which both Houſes can by no means admit, but muſt ſtill deny. But likewiſe to that high and dangerous aſperſion of awing the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this Parliament, raiſed without doubt, purpoſely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valide the Acts and proceeding thereof. And by that engine, in caſe the Popiſh Armie ſhould prevail againſt the Parliament, (which they truſt God in his goodneſſe will never permit) to overturn and nullifie all the good Lawes and Statutes made this Parliament.</p>
            <p>And it would give too much countenance to thoſe unjuſt aſpeſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons laid to the charge of the City of <hi>London,</hi> whoſe unexſampled zeal and fidelity to the true Proteſtant Religion, and the Liberty of this kingdom is never to be forgotten, <hi>That His Majeſty and the Members of both Houſes cannot with ſafety to their perſons reſide there;</hi> when as they are well aſſured, That the loyalty of that City to His Majeſty, and their affections to the Parliament, is ſuch, as doth equall, if not exceed, any other place or City in the Kingdom: And with what ſafety the two Houſes can ſit in any other place, when even in the place they now reſide, the Houſe of Commons was in apparent danger of violence, when His Majeſtie, accompanied with ſome hundreds of armed men, came thither to demand their Members, let the world judge.</p>
            <pb n="101" facs="tcp:111010:48"/>
            <p> And now the Lords and Commons muſt appeal to the judgement of all impartiall men, Whether they have not uſed their utmoſt and moſt faithfull endeavours to put an end to the diſtractions of this Kingdom, and to reſtore it to a bleſſed and laſting Peace; And whether their Propoſitions (being the way thereunto) were not ſuch as were reaſonable and neceſſary for them to make, and juſt and Honourable for His Majeſty to grant; And whether His Mejeſties Anſwer to theſe Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are ſatisfactory, or correſpondent to His Expreſſion, To have <hi>given up all the faculties of His ſoul to an earneſt endeavour of a Peace and Reconciliation With His People:</hi> But they muſt confeſſe, that they had juſt cauſe to ſuſpect, That this would be the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py iſſue of the Treaty; for the prevalency of the enemies thereof, who like that evill ſpirit, do moſt rage when they think they muſt be caſt out, was ſuch, that they would not proceed therein one ſtep, without ſome attempt or provocation layd in the way to interrupt and break it off; for after they had reſolved to preſent their hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſires and propoſitions to His Majeſty, their Committee muſt not without a ſpeciall ſafe counduct and Protection from Him have acceſſe to Him, (a liberty incident to them, not only as they are Members of the Parliament, and employed by both Houſes, but as they were free born Subjects; and yet when they paſſed over this, His Majeſty refuſed a ſafe conduct to the Lord Viſcount <hi>Say</hi> and <hi>Seal,</hi> being one of the Committee appointed by both. Houſes to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed upon that occaſion, ſuch a breach of priviledge that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve is not to be paralelled by the example of former times, and yet their deſire was ſuch to obtain the end they drive at, (that is a happy and laſting peace) That they reſolved not to interrupt the Treaty for that time by inſiſting upon it. And then they had no ſooner entred upon the Treaty, but a Proclamation dated at <hi>Oxon</hi> the 16 of <hi>February,</hi> 1642. entituled His Majeſties Proclamation, forbidding all His loving Subjects, and the Counties of <hi>Kent, Surrey, Suſſex,</hi> and <hi>Hampſhire</hi> to raiſe any Forces, &amp;c. And an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Proclamation dated the 8 of <hi>February,</hi> forbidding the aſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and payment of all Taxes by vertue of an Ordinance of both Houſes, and all entring into Aſſociations, were publiſhed in His Majeſties Name, containing moſt bitter invectives and ſcandalls a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the proceedings of both Houſes, by ſtiling them and ſuch as obeyed them, Traitors, and Rebels, charging them under the name
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:111010:49"/>of Browniſts, Anabaptiſts, and Atheiſts, to endeavour to take away the Kings life, and to deſtory His Poſterity, the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the Laws of the Kingdoms, with many other ſuch ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalls and aſperſions; and even at this time were many deſigns pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing againſt the Parliament, which in all probability were the grounds and reaſons of His Majeſties confidence and deniall of their juſt deſire. Inſomuch, That His Majeſty in a Letter ſent from Him to the Queen, and read in the Houſe of Commons, did declare, That He had ſo many fine deſigns layd open to Him, that He knew not which firſt to undertake. One whereof proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly was the moſt bloody and barbarous deſign upon <hi>Briſtoll</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted (though by Gods infinite mercy prevented) during the Treaty. And whether that of Sir <hi>Hugh Cholmleys</hi> in betraying of <hi>Scarborough</hi> Caſtle, wherwith he was entruſted by the Parliament, to the Queens hands, and acted likewiſe during the Treaty. And that of <hi>Killingworth</hi> Caſtle, which ſhould have been likewiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, and a deſign diſcovered by a Letter found in the Earle of <hi>Northamptons</hi> pocket, ſlain neere <hi>Stafford,</hi> written to him from Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> were ſome of the other deſigns mentioned in His Majeſties Letter, they cannot certainly affirm, but conjecture. And when this collaterall provocations and attempts could not prevaile to make them deſert the Treaty, then comes in His Majeſties Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the fourth of <hi>April,</hi> which they have mentioned before, charging them to abuſe the people with imaginary dangers, and pretended fears, to uſe force and Rapines upon His good Subjects, with publiſhing new doctrines, That it is unlawfull for the King to do any thing, and lawfull to do any thing againſt Him, with malice and ſubtilty to abuſe the people, that their pleaſure is all their bounds; with many other ſuch bitter expreſſions, that no man could think ſuch an Anſwer could be any part of a Treaty, or at leaſt to proceed from a heart that deſired a happy iſſue thereunto. Notwithſtanding all which, the Lords and Commons were ſo reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely fixed to proſecute that Treaty, and (if poſſibly they could) to bring it to a bleſſed and happy concluſion, that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to lye under all theſe ſcandalls, and endure all theſe wounds, ſo they might make up the breaches of the Common-wealth; And therefore they did forbear the returning of an Anſwer to any of theſe provocations. And then when that Malignant and Popiſh party (too too prevalent with his Majeſty) preceived their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:111010:49"/>not to be provoked to break that Treaty of their part, they found it neceſſary to ſeduce His Majeſty to refuſe His conſent to their moſt neceſſary and juſt deſires, and to propound ſuch things as could not with the peace and ſafety of the Church and State be yeelded to, and ſo effected their own deſires. All which, The Lords and Commons thought it their duty to publiſh to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to the end that they may ſee that what hath been long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured by ſubtill and ſecret practiſes, is now reſolved to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by open violence and hoſtility; That is, the deſtruction of our Laws, and the Proteſtant Religion, and introducing of Popery and Superſtition; and that there is little or no hope by any endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of a Treaty to procure the peace of this Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, unleſſe both be expoſed to the will and pleaſure of the Popiſh party, untill the Army and forces now raiſed and continued by them, be firſt deſtroyed or ſuppreſſed. And therefore the Lords and Commons do hope, that not only ſuch as are already convinced of their deſigne and malice; but even thoſe that by their ſubtile and falſe pretences have been ignorantly ſeduced to joyn with them, that love their Liberty and the Proteſtant Religion, will now with one heart and minde, unite together, to preſerve their Religion and Liberty. In the defence whereof, The Lords and Commons are reſolved to offer up themſelves, their lives and fortunes, a willing Sacrifice.</p>
